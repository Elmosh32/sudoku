      <h1>What is Sudoku?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Sudoku</strong> is a popular puzzle game that originated in
        Japan. The game involves a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The
        objective is to fill the entire grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring
        that each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid contains all the
        numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetition. A proper Sudoku puzzle has a
        unique solution that can be reached through logical deduction and
        without guessing. Sudoku puzzles come in varying levels of difficulty,
        from easy to very challenging. They are known for promoting logical
        thinking, concentration, and problem-solving skills. Sudoku has gained
        worldwide popularity and is now enjoyed by people of all ages.

      <h1>Rules of Sudoku</h1>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush list-group-numbered">
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">
          Each row in the 9x9 grid must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9
          without any repetition.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">
          Each column in the 9x9 grid must also contain all the numbers from 1
          to 9 without any repetition.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">
          Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids, also known as regions or blocks, must
          contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetition.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">
          The initial setup of the puzzle may already have some numbers filled
          in. These are called "given" numbers and serve as clues to help you
          solve the puzzle.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">
          To solve the Sudoku puzzle, use logic and deduction to fill in the
          remaining numbers. Avoid guessing, as a proper Sudoku puzzle should
          have a unique solution that can be reached through logical reasoning.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">
          The puzzle is considered solved when the entire grid is filled with
          numbers from 1 to 9, and all the rules are satisfied.
        </li>
      </ul>
